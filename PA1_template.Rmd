## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r echo=TRUE}
        activity <- read.csv(unzip("./activity.zip"))
        head(activity)
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r echo=TRUE, results='markup'}
        library(dplyr)
        grouped_activity <- activity %>% 
                group_by(date) %>% 
                summarise(total_steps = sum(steps))
        hist(grouped_activity$total_steps)
        mean_total_steps <- mean(grouped_activity$total_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
        median_total_steps <- median(grouped_activity$total_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```
The mean total number of steps taken per day is **`r mean_total_steps`**

The median total number of steps taken per day is **`r median_total_steps`**

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
